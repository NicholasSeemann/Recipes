        <p>This recipe will make, what is supposedly, <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/23600/worlds-best-lasagna/">the world's best lasagna.</a>
            Lasagna is an Italian food, or at least I believe it is. The name sounds Italian and I can't be bothered to look it up to avoid having to 
            figure out how I'm supposed to cite a source while making a website, so we are at least going to pretend that it is Italian. I couldn't help myself,
            so out of curiosity I discovered that lasagna is most likely Italian, however there is a chance it could have also come from either

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. 
                Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil,
                1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. 
                Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, 
                remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 375 Degrees F (190 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. 
                Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. 
                Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. 
                Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. 
                Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.
