        <ol>
            <li>
                Make sauerkraut filling: Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. 
                Cook and stir onion in hot butter until translucent, about 5 minutes.
                Add sauerkraut and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 more minutes.
                Season with salt and pepper, then remove to a plate to cool.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make potato filling: Melt butter in the same skillet over medium heat. 
                Cook and stir onion in hot butter until translucent, about 5 minutes. 
                Stir in mashed potatoes, salt, and white pepper. Remove from heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make dough: Beat together sour cream and eggs in a large bowl until smooth. 
                Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into a separate bowl; 
                stir into sour cream mixture until dough comes together.
                Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until firm and smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide dough in half, then roll out one half to 1/8-inch thickness. 
                Cut into 3-inch rounds using a biscuit cutter. 
                Place a small spoonful of potato filling into the center of each round. 
                Moisten edges with water, fold over, and press with a fork to seal. 
                Roll and fill remaining dough half with sauerkraut filling.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Add pierogies in batches to boiling water and cook until they float to the top, 3 to 5 minutes.
                Remove with a slotted spoon.
